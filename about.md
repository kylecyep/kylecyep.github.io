Welcome! My name is Kyle Yep and I am a chemistry major in my 2nd year at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The dream is to have a career in medicine, particularly in the pharmaceutical field. My life has included many wonderful experiences in many different walks of life from being a chemistry tutor, to helping package food in community service, as well as being an avid member of the Cal Poly Mustang Band. Hard work and the determination to never give up always have been the ways that I live my life, and I hope to continue that philosophy through any facet of my life in the future.
